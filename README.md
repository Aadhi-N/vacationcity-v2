  **Description**

    Vacation City is an app that allows people to choose their next vacation based on what the weather is at a particular month around the world.

    Have you ever had difficulty scheduling your future vacation on a particular calendar month, only to find out the city you want to travel to has unideal weather conditions?

    This app helps you narrow down where you'd like to go based on your preferred travel month, temperatures, and humidity!
